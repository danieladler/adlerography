**NB**: Slideshows are currently implemented using [bxSlider](https://github.com/stevenwanderski/bxslider-4). For sliders to display with proper image height inside modals, had to use
a hack involving commenting out some of bxSlider's source code. The hack
was suggested by `tomgallagher` near the bottom of [this thread](https://github.com/stevenwanderski/bxslider-4/issues/952).
